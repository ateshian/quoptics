Wigner Figures + Fock probability figures

Wigner function of each step t_i to t_i+1
Fock state probabilities of each step t_i to t_i+1
Used the analytically calculated t_i as the initial state for the solver and simulated the step from t_i to t_i+1, then compared with the state that we expect to see at t_i+1
The simulation mostly matches the calculation at each step except for a phase shift (shown in the rotation of the resonator Wigner functions). But the Fock state probability distributions are all consistent.
However this phase shift is critical because when the simulation is carried out all the way through, the final target state is not reached
This could be due to an error somewhere in the calculation of times
